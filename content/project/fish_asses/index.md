## Stream assessment and classifications
Stream assessments are important for the conservation and restoration of viable habitat for fish and other aquatic organisms. We perform assessments to maintain or improve opportunities to sustainably use ecosystem values for sustenance, social, ceremonial, recreational and commercial purposes.

New Graph Environment's fish habitat assessment procedures are outlines [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_elk_2022_reporting/methods.html#fish-habitat-assessment) and our results can be found [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_elk_2022_reporting/results.html#weigert-creek---pscis-crossing-197534).

Some example projects are:
- [Tributaries to Revelstoke Lake Fisheries Assessments](https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/public/viewReport.do?reportId=62500)
- [Analysis and Priority Identification of Existing Fish Passage Data: Wahleach Creek Watershed](https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/public/viewReport.do?reportId=54579)
- More reports can be viewed [here](https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/public/search.do)


maybe some mention of fish movement and health tracking through PIT tagging (done in Skeena and Peace projects over multi-year periods)?
