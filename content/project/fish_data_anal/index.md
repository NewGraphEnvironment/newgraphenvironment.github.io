## Duncan Reservoir Kokanee Stock Assessment

We provided data analysis and reporting services to support large lake specialists on a 3-year synthesis report for a water use planning study.  Reporting incorporated results and data from multiple 10-year water use planning projects in the Columbia Basin to explore impacts and mitigation strategies related to flow regulation and water impoundment in the Duncan River watershed. We built tools in R to automate the processing of hydroacoustic fish density outputs and associated water quality (i.e. temperature, conductivity, fluorescence) and zooplankton data.
