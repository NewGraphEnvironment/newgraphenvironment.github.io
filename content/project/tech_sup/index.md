As part of a team working on behalf of Lhooskâ€™uz Dene and Ulkatcho First Nations over a two year period, we led the technical review of aquatic permitting applications for the Blackwater Mine near Vanderhoof BC which included a XXXX ha mine site as well as the 120km long Electrical Transmission Line.

The review included the development of collaborative GIS projects and interactive online tools to build capacity, communicate technical data in plain language and advocate for First Nation interests related to the Environmental Impact assessment, Fisheries and Riparian Offsetting Works, Environmental Effects Monitoring and Mitigation Programs.
