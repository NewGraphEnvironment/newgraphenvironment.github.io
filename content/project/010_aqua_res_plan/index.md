We work with diverse partners to develop watershed level plans that incorporate collaborative GIS workspaces and innovative planning/reporting tools. Planning prioritizes candidate culverts for restoration of fish passage based on habitat assessment results, fish sampling, habitat/fish density modelling and watershed-wide ecological/cultural values.

<br>

The projects provided planning tools for fish passage  assessments as well as to prioritize and rank previously assessed culverts for follow up in preparation for further assessment and fish passage restoration. Rehabilitation opportunities were analyzed within the context of a GIS generated Fish Habitat Model of the known or potential fish habitat located upstream with results presented in report, map and spreadsheet formats.

<br>

Past and current initiatives include fish passage restoration planning for over 20 other watershed groups in British Columbia with clients including Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern BC, First Nation development corporations, Ministry of Water and Land Stewardship,  Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program, Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation, Ministry of Transporrtation and INfrastructure and others. Multi-year efforts are underway within the Skeena River, Elk River and Parsnip River regions. Initiatives have led to substantial funding to support not only fish passage restoration but also successful cattle exclusion fencing, streambank stabilization and riparian planting programs. Online interactive reporting is ongoing with a selection of live websites detailed below:
