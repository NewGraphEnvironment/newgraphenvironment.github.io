# newgraphenvironment.github.io

New Graph Environment company website — landing page, work portfolio, and contact.

## Repository Context

**Repository:** NewGraphEnvironment/newgraphenvironment.github.io
**Domain:** www.newgraphenvironment.com
**Framework:** Hugo via blogdown, hugo-apero theme
**Hosting:** GitHub Pages (via CNAME)
**Build:** `blogdown::serve_site()` for local dev, `blogdown::build_site()` for production. Hugo v0.121.1.

## Site Structure

**Nav:** Our Work | Contact | Blog (external)

**Landing page** (`layouts/index.html`) — custom layout, not the theme default. Sections:
- Hero with full logo + "Open-Source Watershed Science" tagline
- Who We Are — company description
- Our Work — 3 cards linking to project tiles
- Open Source — GitHub link band

**Our Work** (`content/project/`) — 3 tiles:
- `watershed_restoration_fish_passage/` — Neexdzii Kwah restoration + fish passage reports by region (Skeena, Peace, Fraser, Elk). Report lists use `<details>` for collapsible previous reports.
- `aquatic_monitoring_assessment/` — NRP nutrient loading (private report, no link), Duncan kokanee, Sheep Creek benthic/NMDS, fish & habitat assessment.
- `open_source_software/` — R packages (fresh, flooded, drift, breaks, cd, gq, fpr, ngr), STAC catalogs, digital field forms (dff-2022), diggs, fly. Links to pkgdown sites and GitHub repos.

**Contact** (`content/form/contact.md`) — Formspree form with partnership-focused messaging. Custom layout override.

**Blog** — external link to https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/new_graphiti/ — not hosted in this repo.

**About** (`content/about/`) — content exists but not linked in nav. "Who We Are" section on landing page replaced the standalone about page.

## Layout Overrides

These override the hugo-apero theme defaults. Changes here affect the site without touching the theme:

| File | Overrides | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `layouts/index.html` | Theme homepage | Custom landing page with hero, sections, scroll-reveal JS |
| `layouts/form/split-right.html` | Theme contact form | Dark photo backdrop, custom typography |
| `layouts/partials/header.html` | Theme header | Larger logo in nav (`3.5rem`) |

**CSS:** Landing page and contact page styles are inline in their respective layout files using CSS custom properties (`--forest-deep`, `--river-light`, `--cream`, etc.). The theme uses Tachyons CSS + SCSS in `assets/`.

## Images

Images live alongside `index.md` in page bundle directories (not in `static/`). Hugo-apero uses `featured*` filename pattern for grid thumbnails. Logos are in `static/img/`.

## Archive

- `_archive/` — old project pages (pre-restructuring). Kept for reference, not served by Hugo.
- `_archive_tools/` — old standalone tools section. Content moved into `open_source_software/` project tile.

## Key Decisions

- **"Our Work" not "Projects"** — tiles represent types of work, not individual projects. Projects are examples inside each tile.
- **Open Source Software as a work type** — positions tool development as a billable service, not just internal infrastructure.
- **No standalone tools/about pages** — consolidated into landing page and Our Work tiles to reduce nav items.
- **Report links use collapsible sections** — most recent report is always visible, previous years in `<details>` tags.
- **2025 fish passage report links are placeholders** — Peace and Fraser 2025 will 404 until deployed. Skeena 2025 tracked in #43.
- **NRP content has no report link** — report is private.
- **Contact messaging is partnership-focused** — signals multi-year programs, open-source tool development funded through partnerships.

# Code Check Conventions

Structured checklist for reviewing diffs before commit. Used by `/code-check`.
Add new checks here when a bug class is discovered — they compound over time.

## Shell Scripts

### Quoting
- Variables in double-quoted strings containing single quotes break if value has `'`
- `"echo '${VAR}'"` — if VAR contains `'`, shell syntax breaks
- Use `printf '%s\n' "$VAR" | command` to pipe values safely
- Heredocs: unquoted `<<EOF` expands variables locally, `<<'EOF'` does not — know which you need

### Paths
- Hardcoded absolute paths (`/Users/airvine/...`) break for other users
- Use `REPO_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/<relative>" && pwd)"`
- After moving scripts, verify `../` depth still resolves correctly
- Usage comments should match actual script location

### Silent Failures
- `|| true` hides real errors — is the failure actually safe to ignore?
- Empty variable before destructive operation (rm, destroy) — add guard: `[ -n "$VAR" ] || exit 1`
- `grep` returning empty silently — downstream commands get empty input

### Process Visibility
- Secrets passed as command-line args are visible in `ps aux`
- Use env files, stdin pipes, or temp files with `chmod 600` instead

## Cloud-Init (YAML)

### ASCII
- Must be pure ASCII — em dashes, curly quotes, arrows cause silent parse failure
- Check with: `perl -ne 'print "$.: $_" if /[^\x00-\x7F]/' file.yaml`

### State
- `cloud-init clean` causes full re-provisioning on next boot — almost never what you want before snapshot
- Use `tailscale logout` not `tailscale down` before snapshot (deregister vs disconnect)

### Template Variables
- Secrets rendered via `templatefile()` are readable at `169.254.169.254` metadata endpoint
- Acceptable for ephemeral machines, document the tradeoff

## OpenTofu / Terraform

### State
- Parsing `tofu state show` text output is fragile — use `tofu output` instead
- Missing outputs that scripts need — add them to main.tf
- Snapshot/image IDs in tfvars after deleting the snapshot — stale reference

### Destructive Operations
- Validate resource IDs before destroy: `[ -n "$ID" ] || exit 1`
- `tofu destroy` without `-target` destroys everything including reserved IPs
- Snapshot ID extraction: use `--resource droplet` and `grep -F` for exact match

## Security

### Secrets in Committed Files
- `.tfvars` must be gitignored (contains tokens, passwords)
- `.tfvars.example` should have all variables with empty/placeholder values
- Sensitive variables need `sensitive = true` in variables.tf

### Firewall Defaults
- `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH is world-open — document if intentional
- If access is gated by Tailscale, say so explicitly

### Credentials
- Passwords with special chars (`'`, `"`, `$`, `!`) break naive shell quoting
- `printf '%q'` escapes values for shell safety
- Temp files for secrets: create with `chmod 600`, delete after use

## R / Package Installation

### pak Behavior
- pak stops on first unresolvable package — all subsequent packages are skipped
- Removed CRAN packages (like `leaflet.extras`) must move to GitHub source
- PPPM binaries may lag a few hours behind new CRAN releases

### Reproducibility
- Branch pins (`pkg@branch`) are not reproducible — document why used
- Pinned download URLs (RStudio .deb) go stale — document where to update

## General

### Adopting Existing Config

When importing config from one location into a canonical one (legacy `~/.bash_profile` → dotfiles repo, old script's env → repo, another project's `settings.json` → soul):

- **Verify every referenced path/binary exists.** Dead PATH exports, missing interpreters, stale env vars should be cut, not codified.
  Shell paths: `for p in $(echo "$PATH" | tr ':' ' '); do [ -d "$p" ] || echo "DEAD: $p"; done`
- **Ask before dropping a reference** — it may be something the user forgot to reinstall on this machine, not something to delete.
- **Curated subset, not verbatim copy.** The diff should reflect what you verified, not the whole source.

### Documentation Staleness
- Moving/renaming scripts: update CLAUDE.md, READMEs, usage comments
- New variables: update .tfvars.example
- New workflows: update relevant README


# Comms Conventions

This repo has a `comms/` directory — you're in the cross-repo Claude-to-Claude messaging system. Full protocol in `comms/README.md`. Load-bearing behaviors below.

## On Session Start

1. **Inbound scan.** `<this-repo>/comms/*/` — files with `status: open` and mtime newer than your last `comms/` commit are mail for you.
2. **Outbound scan.** For each peer below, check `<peer>/comms/<this-repo>/*.md` — files with `from: <this-repo>, status: open` are your un-answered sent mail.

If either surfaces open threads, raise to the user before starting other work.

## Peers

Repos with active `comms/` directories (update when new repos adopt):

- rtj
- kdot
- soul
- fresh
- link

## Commit Prefix

- `comms(→peer):` — you committed a file in peer's repo (outbound)
- `comms(←peer):` — you committed a file in your own repo (inbound reply)
- `comms:` — meta (close, reopen, rename, README update)

Arrow points to the repo whose `comms/` contains the file you committed.

## Non-negotiables

- One commit per appended message.
- **Push immediately.** Un-pushed comms is invisible to the other Claude.
- Code + comms = separate commits.
- Status flips bundle with the triggering message.
- **Use `git commit --only <file>`** for any commit in a peer's repo (thread files). Immune to index races from parallel sessions — commits only the named path regardless of what else is staged.

## Propagation: soul publishes, peers pull

Soul is the source of truth for `comms/README.md`. Peers sync by running `/comms-init` in their own repo, from their own Claude session. **Do not push README updates into a peer's repo from another session** — cross-session index races can bundle unrelated staged files into misleading commits.

Within your own session, the only things you commit into a peer's repo are **thread files** (hosted in the receiver's repo per the receiver-hosts rule). Everything else — README syncs, infra — the peer-Claude pulls itself.

### Cross-repo thread commits: which branch?

Commit on peer's **current branch** — whatever they've got checked out. Don't stash, switch, or force main.

If peer isn't on main, surface to the user: _"thread landing on `<peer>`:`<branch>`, won't hit main until PR merges. Continue or hold?"_ If peer has complicated local state (mid-rebase, partial merge), defer to the user.


# LLM Behavioral Guidelines

<!-- Source: https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills/main/CLAUDE.md -->
<!-- Last synced: 2026-02-06 -->
<!-- These principles are hardcoded locally. We do not curl at deploy time. -->
<!-- Periodically check the source for meaningful updates. -->

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.


**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.


# New Graph Environment Conventions

Core patterns for professional, efficient workflows across New Graph Environment repositories.

## Ecosystem Overview

Five repos form the governance and operations layer across all New Graph Environment work:

| Repo | Purpose | Analogy |
|------|---------|---------|
| [compass](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/compass) | Ethics, values, guiding principles | The "why" |
| [soul](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/soul) | Standards, skills, conventions for LLM agents | The "how" |
| [compost](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/compost) | Communications templates, email workflows, contact management | The "who" |
| [rtj](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/rtj) (formerly awshak) | Infrastructure as Code, deployment | The "where" |
| [gq](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/gq) | Cartographic style management across QGIS, tmap, leaflet, web | The "look" |

**Adaptive management:** Conventions evolve from real project work, not theory. When a pattern is learned or refined during project work, propagate it back to soul so all projects benefit. The `/claude-md-init` skill builds each project's `CLAUDE.md` from soul conventions.

**Cross-references:** [sred-2025-2026](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/sred-2025-2026) tracks R&D activities across repos. Compost is the centralized communications workflow — all email drafts, contact registry, and external outreach are authored there, not in individual project repos.

## Issue Workflow

### Before Creating an Issue (non-negotiable)

1. **Check for duplicates:** `gh issue list --state open --search "<keywords>"` -- search before creating
2. **Link to SRED:** If work involves infrastructure, R&D, tooling, or performance benchmarking, add `Relates to NewGraphEnvironment/sred-2025-2026#N` (match by repo name in SRED issue title)
3. **One issue, one concern.** Keep focused.

### Professional Issue Writing

Write issues with clear technical focus:

- **Use normal technical language** in titles and descriptions
- **Focus on the problem and solution** approach
- **Add tracking links at the end** (e.g., `Relates to Owner/repo#N`)

#### Client-aware tone

Issues, PR descriptions, and commit messages are client-visible deliverables, not internal notes.

Avoid in these artifacts:
- Framing work as unsolicited or unpaid ("not assigned by a client")
- Self-justifying adjectives ("defensible", "rigorous") — show, don't claim
- Internal workflow meta (PWF refs, SRED xrefs, planning context)
- Performative effort language ("attempts were unsuccessful") — state factual current state

**Integrity-preserving ≠ self-effacing.** Factual, not performatively humble.

**Scope:** repo artifacts (issues, PRs, commits, reports). Does not apply to internal planning docs, CLAUDE.md, or chat.

**Issue body structure:**
```markdown
## Problem
<what's wrong or missing>

## Proposed Solution
<approach>

Relates to #<local>
Relates to NewGraphEnvironment/sred-2025-2026#<N>
```

### GitHub Issue Creation - Always Use Files

The `gh issue create` command with heredoc syntax fails repeatedly with EOF errors. ALWAYS use `--body-file`:

```bash
cat > /tmp/issue_body.md << 'EOF'
## Problem
...

## Proposed Solution
...
EOF

gh issue create --title "Brief technical title" --body-file /tmp/issue_body.md
```

## Closing Issues

**DO:** Close issues via commit messages. The commit IS the closure and the documentation.

```
Fix broken DEM path in loading pipeline

Update hardcoded path to use config-driven resolution.

Fixes #20
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**DON'T:** Close issues with `gh issue close`. This breaks the audit trail — there's no linked diff showing what changed.

- `Fixes #N` or `Closes #N` — auto-closes and links the commit to the issue
- `Relates to #N` — partial progress, does not close
- Always close issues when work is complete. Don't leave stale open issues.

## Commit Quality

Write clear, informative commit messages:

```
Brief description (50 chars or less)

Detailed explanation of changes and impact.

Fixes #<issue> (or Relates to #<issue>)
Relates to NewGraphEnvironment/sred-2025-2026#<N>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**When to commit:**
- Logical, atomic units of work
- Working state (tests pass)
- Clear description of changes

**What to avoid:**
- "WIP" or "temp" commits in main branch
- Combining unrelated changes
- Vague messages like "fixes" or "updates"

## LLM Agent Conventions

Rules learned from real project sessions. These apply across all repos.

- **Install missing packages, don't workaround** — if a package is needed, ask the user to install it (e.g. `pak::pak("pkg")`). Don't write degraded fallback code to avoid the dependency.
- **Never hardcode extractable data** — if coordinates, station names, or metadata can be pulled from an API or database at runtime, do that. Don't hardcode values that have a programmatic source.
- **Close issues via commits, not `gh issue close`** — see Closing Issues above.
- **Cite primary sources** — see references conventions.

## Naming Conventions

**Pattern: `noun_verb-detail`** -- noun first, verb second across all naming:

| What | Example |
|------|---------|
| Skills | `claude-md-init`, `gh-issue-create`, `planning-update` |
| Scripts | `stac_register-baseline.sh`, `stac_register-pypgstac.sh` |
| Logs | `20260209_stac_register-baseline_stac-dem-bc.txt` |
| Log format | `yyyymmdd_noun_verb-detail_target.ext` |

Scripts and logs live together: `scripts/<module>/logs/`

## Projects vs Milestones

- **Projects** = daily cross-repo tracking (always add to relevant project)
- **Milestones** = iteration boundaries (only for release/claim prep)
- Don't double-track unless there's a reason

| Content | Project |
|---------|---------|
| R&D, experiments, SRED-related | **SRED R&D Tracking (#8)** |
| Data storage, sqlite, postgres, pipelines | **Data Architecture (#9)** |
| Fish passage field/reporting | **Fish Passage 2025 (#6)** |
| Restoration planning | **Aquatic Restoration Planning (#5)** |
| QGIS, Mergin, field forms | **Collaborative GIS (#3)** |


# Planning Conventions

How Claude manages structured planning for complex tasks using planning-with-files (PWF).

## When to Plan

Use PWF when a task has multiple phases, requires research, or involves more than ~5 tool calls. Triggers:
- User says "let's plan this", "plan mode", "use planning", or invokes `/planning-init`
- Complex issue work begins (multi-step, uncertain approach)
- Claude judges the task warrants structured tracking

Skip planning for single-file edits, quick fixes, or tasks with obvious next steps.

## The Workflow

1. **Explore first** — Enter plan mode (read-only). Read code, trace paths, understand the problem before proposing anything.
2. **Plan to files** — Write the plan into 3 files in `planning/active/`:
   - `task_plan.md` — Phases with checkbox tasks
   - `findings.md` — Research, discoveries, technical analysis
   - `progress.md` — Session log with timestamps and commit refs
3. **Commit the plan** — Commit the planning files before starting implementation. This is the baseline.
4. **Work in atomic commits** — Each commit bundles code changes WITH checkbox updates in the planning files. The diff shows both what was done and the checkbox marking it done.
5. **Code check before commit** — Run `/code-check` on staged diffs before committing. Don't mark a task done until the diff passes review.
6. **Archive when complete** — Move `planning/active/` to `planning/archive/` via `/planning-archive`. Write a README.md in the archive directory with a one-paragraph outcome summary and closing commit/PR ref — future sessions scan these to catch up fast.

## Atomic Commits (Critical)

Every commit that completes a planned task MUST include:
- The code/script changes
- The checkbox update in `task_plan.md` (`- [ ]` -> `- [x]`)
- A progress entry in `progress.md` if meaningful

This creates a git audit trail where `git log -- planning/` tells the full story. Each commit is self-documenting — you can backtrack with git and understand everything that happened.

## File Formats

### task_plan.md

Phases with checkboxes. This is the core tracking file.

```markdown
# Task Plan

## Phase 1: [Name]
- [ ] Task description
- [ ] Another task

## Phase 2: [Name]
- [ ] Task description
```

Mark tasks done as they're completed: `- [x] Task description`

### findings.md

Append-only research log. Discoveries, technical analysis, things learned.

```markdown
# Findings

## [Topic]
[What was found, with source/date]
```

### progress.md

Session entries with commit references.

```markdown
# Progress

## Session YYYY-MM-DD
- Completed: [items]
- Commits: [refs]
- Next: [items]
```

## Directory Structure

```
planning/
  active/          <- Current work (3 PWF files)
  archive/         <- Completed issues
    YYYY-MM-issue-N-slug/
```

If `planning/` doesn't exist in the repo, run `/planning-init` first.

## Skills

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/planning-init` | First time in a repo — creates directory structure |
| `/planning-update` | Mid-session — sync checkboxes and progress |
| `/planning-archive` | Issue complete — archive and create fresh active/ |


# Reference Management Conventions

How references flow between Claude Code, Zotero, and technical writing at New Graph Environment.

## Tool Routing

Three tools, different purposes. Use the right one.

| Need | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Search by keyword, read metadata/fulltext, semantic search | **MCP `zotero_*` tools** | pyzotero, works with Zotero item keys |
| Look up by citation key (e.g., `irvine2020ParsnipRiver`) | **`/zotero-lookup` skill** | Citation keys are a BBT feature — pyzotero can't resolve them |
| Create items, attach PDFs, deduplicate | **`/zotero-api` skill** | Connector API for writes, JS console for attachments |

**Citation keys vs item keys:** Citation keys (like `irvine2020ParsnipRiver`) come from Better BibTeX. Item keys (like `K7WALMSY`) are native Zotero. The MCP works with item keys. `/zotero-lookup` bridges citation keys to item data.

**BBT citation key storage:** As of Feb 2025+, BBT stores citation keys as a `citationKey` field directly in `zotero.sqlite` (via Zotero's item data system), not in a separate BBT database. The old `better-bibtex.sqlite` and `better-bibtex.migrated` files are stale and no longer updated. Query citation keys with: `SELECT idv.value FROM items i JOIN itemData id ON i.itemID = id.itemID JOIN itemDataValues idv ON id.valueID = idv.valueID JOIN fields f ON id.fieldID = f.fieldID WHERE f.fieldName = 'citationKey'`.

## Adding References Workflow

### 1. Search and flag

When research turns up a reference:
- **DOI available:** Tell the user — Zotero's magic wand (DOI lookup) is the fastest path
- **ResearchGate link:** Flag to user for manual check — programmatic fetch is blocked (403), but full text is often there
- **BC gov report:** Search [ACAT](https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/), for.gov.bc.ca library, EIRS viewer
- **Paywalled:** Note it, move on. Don't waste time trying to bypass.

### 2. Add to Zotero

**Preferred order:**
1. DOI magic wand in Zotero UI (fastest, most complete metadata)
2. Web API POST with `collections` array (grey literature, local PDFs — targets collection directly, no UI interaction needed)
3. `saveItems` via `/zotero-api` (batch creation from structured data — requires UI collection selection)
4. JS console script for group library (when connector can't target the right collection)

**Collection targeting:** `saveItems` drops items into whatever collection is selected in Zotero's UI. Always confirm with the user before calling it. **Web API bypasses this** — include `"collections": ["KEY"]` in the POST body. Find collection keys with `?q=name` search on the collections endpoint.

### 3. Attach PDFs

`saveItems` attachments silently fail. Don't use them. Instead:

1. **Web API S3 upload (preferred):** Create attachment item → get upload auth → build S3 body (Python: prefix + file bytes + suffix) → POST to S3 → register with uploadKey. Works without Zotero running. See `/zotero-api` skill section 4.
2. **JS console fallback:** Download with `curl`, attach via `item_attach_pdf.js` in Zotero JS console.
3. Verify attachment exists via MCP: `zotero_get_item_children`

### 4. Verify

After manual adds, confirm via MCP:
- `zotero_search_items` — find by title
- `zotero_get_item_metadata` — check fields are complete
- `zotero_get_item_children` — confirm PDF attached

### 5. Clean up

If duplicates were created (common with `saveItems` retries):
- Run `collection_dedup.js` via Zotero JS console
- It keeps the copy with the most attachments, trashes the rest

## In Reports (bookdown)

### Bibliography generation

```yaml
# index.Rmd — dynamic bib from Zotero via Better BibTeX
bibliography: "`r rbbt::bbt_write_bib('references.bib', overwrite = TRUE)`"
```

`rbbt` pulls from BBT, which syncs with Zotero. Edit references in Zotero → rebuild report → bibliography updates.

**Library targeting:** rbbt must know which Zotero library to search. This is set globally in `~/.Rprofile`:

```r
# default library — NewGraphEnvironment group (libraryID 9, group 4733734)
options(rbbt.default.library_id = 9)
```

Without this option, rbbt searches only the personal library (libraryID 1) and won't find group library references. The library IDs map to Zotero's internal numbering — use `/zotero-lookup` with `SELECT DISTINCT libraryID FROM citationkey` against the BBT database to discover available libraries.

### Citation syntax

- `[@key2020]` — parenthetical: (Author 2020)
- `@key2020` — narrative: Author (2020)
- `[@key1; @key2]` — multiple
- `nocite:` in YAML — include uncited references

### Cite primary sources

When a review paper references an older study, trace back to the original and cite it. Don't attribute findings to the review when the original exists. (See LLM Agent Conventions in `newgraph.md`.)

**When the original is unavailable** (paywalled, out of print, can't locate): use secondary citation format in the prose and include bib entries for both sources:

> Smith et al. (2003; as cited in Doctor 2022) found that...

Both `@smith2003` and `@doctor2022` go in the `.bib` file. The reader can then track down the original themselves. Flag incomplete metadata on the primary entry — it's better to have a partial reference than none at all.

## PDF Fallback Chain

When you need a PDF and the obvious URL doesn't work:

1. DOI resolver → publisher site (often has OA link)
2. Europe PMC (`europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC{ID}&blobtype=pdf`) — ncbi blocks curl
3. SciELO — needs `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0` header
4. ResearchGate — flag to user for manual download
5. Semantic Scholar — sometimes has OA links
6. Ask user for institutional access

Always verify downloads: `file paper.pdf` should say "PDF document", not HTML.

## Searching Paper Content (ragnar)

### Setup (per project)
- `scripts/rag_build.R` — maps citation keys to Zotero PDF attachment keys, builds DuckDB
- `data/rag/` gitignored — store is local, not committed
- Dependencies: ragnar, Ollama with nomic-embed-text model
- See `/lit-search` skill for full recipe

### Query
`ragnar_store_connect()` then `ragnar_retrieve()` — returns chunks with source file attribution.

### Anti-patterns
- NEVER write abstracts manually — if CrossRef has no abstract, leave blank
- NEVER cite specific numbers without verifying from the source PDF via ragnar search
- NEVER paraphrase equations — copy exact notation and cite page/section


# SRED Conventions

How SR&ED tracking integrates with New Graph Environment's development workflows.

## The Claim: One Project

All SRED-eligible work across NGE falls under a **single continuous project**:

> **Dynamic GIS-based Data Processing and Reporting Framework**

- **Field:** Software Engineering (2.02.09)
- **Start date:** May 2022
- **Fiscal year:** May 1 – April 30
- **Consultant:** Boast Capital (prepares final technical report)

**Do not fragment work into separate claims.** Each fiscal year's work is structured as iterations within this one project. Internal tracking (experiment numbers in `sred-2025-2026`) maps to iterations — Boast assembles the final narrative.

## Tagging Work for SRED

### Commits

## What Qualifies as SRED

**Eligible (systematic investigation to overcome technological uncertainty):**
- Building tools/functions that don't exist in standard practice
- Prototyping new integrations between systems (GIS ↔ reporting ↔ field collection)
- Testing whether an approach works and documenting why it did/didn't
- Iterating on failed approaches with new hypotheses

**Not eligible:**
- Standard configuration of known tools
- Routine bug fixes in working systems
- Writing reports using the framework (that's service delivery)

**The test:** "Did we try something we weren't sure would work, and did we learn something from the attempt?" If yes, it's likely eligible.
